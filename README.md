# odin-recipes
This project builds on the foundations of HTML and CSS that I have learned through The Odin Project.

The project consists of creating a website containing an index page with links to a few recipes.

From this project, I have learned:

* How to structure a website with HTML
* How style a website with CSS
* How to use Git and Github
